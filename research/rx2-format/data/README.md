# RX2 Source Material

This directory contains original RX2 files used for research and testing in our RX2 format reverse engineering project.

## Source

These files are sourced from [Rhythm Lab](https://rhythm-lab.com/breakbeats), a comprehensive collection of classic breakbeats and drum loops that have shaped electronic music production.

## Contents

- **Drums Of Death - Bonus Beat 1.rx2** - Electronic breakbeat sample
- **Dynamic 7 - Squeezeme (part1).rx2** - Drum and bass style break
- **Erik - Child of The Sea.rx2** - Ambient/electronic drum pattern
- **FBI - FBI.rx2** - Classic hip-hop style break
- **James Brown - Funky Drummer.rx2** - The legendary "Funky Drummer" break, one of the most sampled drum breaks in hip-hop history

## Importance

These files represent diverse styles of breakbeats that are foundational to electronic music production:

1. **Historical Significance**: Contains samples that have been used in countless productions across genres
2. **Technical Diversity**: Different BPMs, time signatures, and production styles
3. **Cultural Impact**: Represents the evolution of sampling and breakbeat culture from hip-hop to drum and bass to modern electronic music

## Role in This Experiment

These files serve as:

- **Format Validation**: Testing our RX2 parsing algorithm against diverse real-world content
- **Edge Case Discovery**: Different production techniques may reveal unique RX2 encoding patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring our reverse engineering works across various musical contexts
- **Reference Material**: Providing known-good RX2 files for algorithm development

## Musical Context
