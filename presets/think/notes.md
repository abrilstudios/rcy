# Think Break

The Think break comes from "Think (About It)" by Lyn Collins (1972), produced by James Brown. This break became a staple in jungle and drum & bass production, offering a cleaner, more defined sound compared to the Amen break.

## Style Notes

### Source Direct Style
Source Direct (Jim Baker and Phil Aslett) utilized the Think break with a distinctly dark, technical approach:
- Precise, surgical cutting techniques
- Often layered with atmospheric, almost cinematic elements
- Complex arrangements with meticulous attention to detail
- Notable tracks: "Snake Style", "Secret Liaison", "The Cult"

### Paradox Style
Paradox (Dev Pandya) employs the Think break with a focus on rhythm and space:
- Attention to ghost notes and subtle percussion elements
- Creative use of silence and timing to create tension
- Often maintains the organic feel of the original break
- Notable tracks: "Reminiscence", "A Certain Sound"

## Technical Notes

The original Think break is approximately 105 BPM but was typically sped up considerably in jungle/drum & bass productions.

The break is notable for its clean separation between elements, which makes it excellent for precise slicing. The kick drum in particular has been extensively sampled across various genres.
