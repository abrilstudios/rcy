## Implementation Plan

This issue will be broken down into several phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Initial Architecture Setup
   - Create Store for centralized state
   - Implement Actions and Dispatcher
   - Modify Controller to use new architecture

2. **Phase 2**: View Refactoring
   - Add new signals to View components
   - Update view methods for one-way flow

3. **Phase 3**: Zoom Functionality Refactoring
   - Implement zoom with one-way data flow
   - Test new zoom functionality

4. **Phase 4**: Migrate Other Components
   - Update playback, marker, segment handling

5. **Phase 5**: Testing and Validation
   - Ensure all functionality works properly

## Next Steps

The design phase is complete, and we're ready to begin implementation with Phase 1.
