Key Details on Akai's Time-Stretch Method:
Grain-Based Time-Stretching:

The Akai S1000/S1100 time-stretch algorithm was based on grains—small audio segments that are repeated or skipped to stretch or compress audio while maintaining the original pitch.
The grains would overlap slightly to minimize gaps, ensuring that the output sounded as continuous as possible.
Configurable Parameters:

Grain Size: The grain size was likely configurable, but users did not directly choose grain size as a granular time-stretching parameter in the same way as modern DAWs. Instead, users interacted with time-stretching using broader, higher-level parameters such as percentage-based time stretch or duration.
Stretch Ratio: The stretch ratio (often expressed as a percentage of the original length) was the primary user-configurable parameter. For example, users would set a time-stretch value like 120% to stretch a sample to 120% of its original duration.
The grain size likely depended on the stretch ratio, with smaller grains used for greater stretch amounts. This could have been an internal adjustment that the user didn’t directly control.
Default Grain Size:

While Akai didn’t publicly document the exact default grain size, user experiences suggest that the grains were around 10 to 50 milliseconds long. This is inferred from the quality and artifacts produced by the time-stretching. Smaller grains (around 10ms) are typically better for rhythmic content and can reduce noticeable artifacts.
Some samplers and software from the same era (e.g., early Ensoniq samplers) had grain sizes in this range, so it’s a reasonable assumption that Akai followed a similar practice.
Artifacts and Sound:

Akai's time-stretching introduced noticeable artifacts, but these became part of its characteristic sound and were embraced by many producers, especially in electronic and hip-hop music.
Common artifacts included:
Stuttering: A result of overlapping grains, particularly at slower stretch rates.
Grainy or Choppy Texture: The grains were large enough to be noticeable when the audio was stretched significantly, especially with percussive sounds or fast transients.
Smearing: This happened if the grains were not perfectly aligned, which could cause smearing of transients (especially for fast, rhythmic content like drum loops).
Formant Preservation:

The Akai samplers did not preserve formants in the way modern algorithms like Rubberband or Elastique do. This led to a distinct “pitch-drift” sound that could make vocals sound unnatural when stretched. However, for drums and rhythmic sounds, this was often less of an issue and, in many cases, became a desirable effect.
Manual Control:

Users could manually control the stretch amount, which effectively controlled how many grains were added or skipped. The user interface allowed users to stretch samples by percentage, making the audio longer (e.g., stretching a drum loop to fit a different tempo).
There were usually two stretch parameters: one for the amount of time-stretch and one for the quality of the stretch (which might have influenced grain overlap and interpolation).
Stretch Quality:

Higher-quality stretches used longer grains with more overlap, resulting in fewer artifacts but a slightly blurrier sound. Lower-quality stretches used smaller grains with less overlap, leading to more artifacts but a sharper sound that sometimes worked well for certain types of percussion.
Real-Time Performance:

Real-time time-stretching was not feasible on the S1000, but the later Akai S1100 improved on this. However, the time-stretching was still a relatively slow process, and stretching had to be rendered before playback.
Summary of Key Points:
Grain Size: Likely in the range of 10 to 50 milliseconds, possibly adjusted internally based on the stretch ratio.
Configurable Stretch Ratio: Users specified the stretch ratio or percentage (e.g., 120%), and the Akai would handle the rest.
Artifacts: Akai time-stretching introduced artifacts like stuttering, graininess, and transient smearing, which became part of its characteristic sound.
Quality vs. Speed Trade-off: Users could adjust between faster, more artifact-prone stretches or slower, smoother results.
No Formant Preservation: The time-stretching did not preserve pitch or formants perfectly, which led to audible changes in pitch quality, especially for vocals and melodic content.
Influence on Modern Music:
The Akai time-stretching artifacts became highly influential in music production, particularly in genres like jungle, drum and bass, and hip-hop, where producers used the gritty sound of the stretched samples to their advantage. The classic “stretched amen break” sound often used in jungle tracks is a direct result of this time-stretching technique.
