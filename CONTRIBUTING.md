# ü§ù Contributing to RCY

Welcome! RCY is more than just a waveform editor ‚Äî it's a model for building thoughtful, opinionated, and maintainable software for musicians and producers. If you're interested in contributing, this guide will help you understand how to participate in a way that aligns with the project's values.

## Why This Project Matters

RCY marks a shift in how we engage with creative tools. Instead of relying on locked-down ecosystems from major software vendors, it offers an alternative: open, transparent, and shaped by the needs of artists, not corporate roadmaps.

It reclaims the means of making ‚Äî turning what was once a black-box product into a flexible, legible, and hackable process. Users aren't just consumers of loops and effects; they are editors, designers, and collaborators in shaping how breakbeats live and evolve.

By surfacing ideas like presets with lineage, visual ergonomics, and even gesture aesthetics, RCY shows how tools can reflect culture ‚Äî not just function. It treats software not as a marketplace offering, but as a site of taste, memory, and shared experimentation.

This is what happens when the people who use the tools start building them ‚Äî not just for efficiency, but for meaning.

## üå± Guiding Principles

- **Taste matters**: RCY prioritizes meaningful defaults, not endless options. Our presets, UI feel, and aesthetic decisions are intentional.
- **Refactor for clarity**: Code should be expressive and modular. Don't pile features into tangled conditionals ‚Äî split them out.
- **Be explicit**: Avoid clever abstractions unless they make behavior easier to understand.
- **UX before feature count**: Even small visual details (like marker gravity or triangle direction) are critical to the experience.
- **Preserve lineage**: Breakbeat culture and classic workflows matter. Features that honor historic workflows (e.g., S1000 slicing styles) are encouraged.

## üìê How to Contribute

### 1. Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tnn1t1s/rcy.git
cd rcy
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/python/main.py
```

Ensure you're using Python 3.10+ and PyQt6.

---

### 2. Follow the Branching Strategy

- **Feature branches**: `feature/your-feature-name`
- **Bugfix branches**: `fix/bug-description`
- **Cleanup/refactor**: `cleanup/target-area`

Use clear names and link to GitHub issues when opening PRs.

---

### 3. Testing Expectations

RCY has growing test coverage. For now:

- **Write tests** for non-UI modules (e.g. audio processing, slicing, preview)
- **Use visual regression** (screenshot comparison) for UI when possible
- **Manual testing is OK** for UX/feel features ‚Äî just document what you tried

---

### 4. Design-First Contributions

Big changes should follow this pattern:

1. Open an issue with a detailed spec (see [issue #68](https://github.com/tnn1t1s/rcy/issues/68) for a good example)
2. Link to a `designs/*.md` file if applicable
3. Wait for discussion before implementation (especially architectural changes)

---

## ‚úÖ Good First Tasks

- Improve UI responsiveness (see `rcy_view.py`)
- Enhance preset metadata (add more presets with artist/measure info)
- Add hover/loop interaction polish
- Write markdown docs for existing features (e.g. split-by-transients)

---

## üß† Learn from RCY

RCY is also a **teaching tool** ‚Äî it's here to demonstrate:

- How to structure UIs that respect legacy workflows
- How to use config, tests, and careful design decisions
- How to write software *with intent*

If you're new to Qt, audio tooling, or breakbeat culture ‚Äî welcome! We're building something that remembers where it came from.

Thanks for being here. Let's make beautiful, playable tools.
