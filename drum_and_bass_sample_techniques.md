# Drum & Bass Sampling Techniques: From Akai Samplers to Modern Workflows

## Akai S950 & S1000 – The Samplers that Shaped Early Jungle/DnB
In the early 1990s, the *Akai* S950 and S1000 digital samplers were the secret weapons behind the emerging **jungle** and **drum and bass** sound. These rack-mounted samplers, despite their now-primitive specs, enabled a new kind of music-making that defined the era's aesthetic.

The S950 offered 12-bit/26kHz sampling that imparted a distinctive gritty character to samples, while the S1000 provided cleaner 16-bit/44.1kHz sampling. The relatively small memory capacity (750kB standard on the S950) forced producers to make creative decisions that shaped the genre:

- **Extreme time-stretching**: Producers would drastically slow down breakbeats, creating the characteristic "timestretched" sound with digital artifacts
- **Pitch shifting**: Raising or lowering pitch without affecting tempo, essential for matching breaks to track tempos
- **Resampling**: Processing samples through external effects and resampling the results, creating increasingly abstract sounds
- **Tight looping**: Creating short, precise loops from drum breaks to extend limited memory

## The Amen Break – A Foundation of Jungle and DnB

The "Amen Break" – a six-second drum solo from The Winstons' 1969 track "Amen, Brother" – became the cornerstone of jungle and drum & bass production. This iconic break has been:

- Chopped into individual hits (kick, snare, hi-hat)
- Rearranged into new patterns
- Layered with other breaks
- Processed through various effects
- Time-stretched to create tension and release

## Classic Techniques and Their Modern Equivalents

### Timestretching and Pitchshifting
**Then**: Akai samplers had primitive algorithms that created distinctive artifacts when stretching audio
**Now**: Modern DAWs offer multiple timestretching algorithms that can emulate vintage artifacts or provide clean stretching

### Resampling and Layering
**Then**: Recording the output of hardware samplers back onto tape or into another sampler
**Now**: Bounce-in-place or audio rendering features in DAWs accomplish this digitally

### Processing and Effects
**Then**: External hardware compressors, EQs, and reverbs
**Now**: Plugin chains that often emulate classic hardware

## The "Think" and "Apache" Breaks

Beyond the Amen break, other foundational loops shaped the genre:

- **Think Break**: From Lyn Collins' "Think (About It)" – characterized by its punchy snare and driving rhythm
- **Apache Break**: From Incredible Bongo Band's "Apache" – featuring a distinctive bongo pattern and open hi-hats

## Key Producers and Their Techniques

- **Goldie**: Pioneered extreme timestretching and abstract sound design
- **Photek**: Known for intricate drum programming and layering multiple breaks
- **Dillinja**: Created the "Valve" sound system specifically to reproduce his heavy bass-focused productions
- **LTJ Bukem**: Developed atmospheric, jazz-influenced production techniques

## Modern Software Emulation

Today's producers can achieve these classic techniques through:

- Specialized plugins that emulate 12-bit/early digital sampling
- Convolution reverbs with impulse responses from classic hardware
- Sample packs of pre-processed classic breaks
- Modern DAWs with integrated timestretching and pitchshifting capabilities

## The Impact on Contemporary Production

These early sampling techniques continue to influence modern electronic music:

- The "Golden Era" sound is frequently revisited in contemporary jungle and drum & bass
- Lo-fi aesthetics derived from hardware limitations are now intentional stylistic choices
- Chopping and manipulating breaks remains fundamental to many genres beyond drum & bass
- The characteristic sound of timestretch artifacts has become part of the musical vocabulary
