# RCY

**RCY** is a tool designed to process breakbeat loops, enabling users to slice and export them in the **SFZ** format for seamless integration with samplers like the **TAL-Sampler**. Inspired by the aesthetics of New Order's Movement, brutalist design, and hauntological software, RCY combines utility with an appreciation for drum break history.

## Features

- **Breakbeat Slicing**: Automatically detects transients in breakbeat loops and slices them into individual hits
- **Manual Editing**: Precisely place slice points for customized break cutting patterns
- **Selection & Trimming**: Trim audio with start/end markers for perfect loop isolation
- **SFZ Export**: Generate SFZ files with mappings corresponding to the sliced samples for easy import into samplers
- **Historically-Informed Presets**: Access artist-specific slice patterns based on classic jungle and drum & bass techniques
- **Cohesive Design Language**: Distinctive aesthetic based on a consistent color palette and typography

## Design Philosophy

RCY isn't just a tool—it's a perspective on breakbeat culture. The design references hauntological approaches to music technology, with:

- A color palette inspired by New Order's Movement album artwork
- Brutalist interface elements that emphasize function and clarity
- A typography system based on Futura PT Book
- A careful balance between utility and historical resonance

Read our [Breakbeat Science](docs/breakbeat-science.md) guide to understand the three core workflows that shaped jungle, drum & bass, and big beat, and how they're implemented in RCY. For those interested in the history and techniques of sampling in drum & bass, check out our comprehensive [Drum & Bass Sampling Techniques](docs/drum_and_bass_sample_techniques.md) document.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**: RCY requires Python 3.11 or higher
- **Dependencies**: Install necessary Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file
  - For Python 3.13+ support, use `requirements-py313.txt` instead

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tnn1t1s/rcy.git
   cd rcy
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # For Python 3.11-3.12
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # For Python 3.13+
   pip install -r requirements-py313.txt
   ```

## Development Setup

RCY uses modern Python development tools:

- **Code Quality**: [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting
- **Type Checking**: [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/) for static type analysis
- **Package Management**: `pyproject.toml` configuration
- **Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests

For development details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Architecture

RCY follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with clear separation of concerns. For detailed information about the system architecture and modernization phases, see [docs/mvc-current-flow.md](docs/mvc-current-flow.md).

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**:
   ```bash
   python3 src/python/main.py
   ```

2. **Work with Audio**:
   - The application loads with the Amen break by default
   - Load custom audio with File > Open
   - Set slice points automatically with "Split by Transients" or manually with Alt+Click
   - Adjust the Onset Threshold slider to control automatic transient detection sensitivity
   - Use the measure-based slicing for rhythmically perfect divisions

3. **Selection and Trimming**:
   - Set a start marker with Shift+Click (blue)
   - Set an end marker with Ctrl+Click (blue) 
   - Click the "Cut Selection" button to trim audio to just the selected region

4. **Export Results**:
   - Export your sliced samples and SFZ file using File > Export
   - Choose a destination directory for all exported files

## Historical Presets

The `presets/` directory contains historically-informed breakbeat slice patterns based on specific artists:

- **Amen Break**: Dillinja and LTJ Bukem cutting styles
- **Think Break**: Source Direct and Paradox approaches
- **Apache Break**: Photek-inspired edits

Each preset includes documentation about the artistic context and technical approach. For a deeper understanding of the cultural and technical foundations of these presets, see our [Breakbeat Science](docs/breakbeat-science.md) document.
