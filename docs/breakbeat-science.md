# 🥁 Breakbeat Science: Three Core Workflows That Shaped Jungle, D&B, and Big Beat

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines the **three foundational workflows** used in classic breakbeat culture — particularly in the evolution of jungle, drum & bass, and big beat. These techniques predate modern DAWs and define a mindset where slicing, timing, and taste mattered more than fidelity or polish.

RCY encodes these workflows natively — not as nostalgic artifacts, but as **living techniques**.

## 1. ⏱️ Split by Grid (Quantized Measures/Beats/16ths)

### 💡 Idea
Chop the loop by **time**, not transients. Use equal divisions (e.g. 16th notes across 1–4 measures).

### 🧠 Why It Mattered
- It made rhythmic displacement *easy* in samplers (S950, S1000, etc.)
- Encouraged **syncopation** by letting producers shuffle slices off-grid
- No need to understand where the snare is — just *feel* where to move things

### 🎧 Used By
- **Remarc**, **Dillinja**, **4hero** — early jungle programmers
- **The Chemical Brothers**, **Fatboy Slim** — big beat architects who weaponized repetition and groove

### 🛠️ In RCY
- Use "Split by Measures" and set subdivision to 16th, 8th, or 4th notes
- No transient detection required — just a measure count and tempo

---

## 2. ✂️ Manual Slicing by Feel

### 💡 Idea
Place each slice **by hand** where it sounds right — not necessarily on grid lines.

### 🧠 Why It Mattered
- Allowed expressive, humanized grooves
- Essential when breaks weren't recorded cleanly or had complex swing
- Gave rise to signature feels (e.g. **Tim Goldsworthy** manually slicing to shape early Mo'Wax and DFA textures)

### 🎧 Used By
- **Goldie** (on Timeless)
- **Roni Size**
- **Massive Attack** (esp. *Mezzanine* era)

### 🛠️ In RCY
- Use the manual marker system or disable grid-based splitting entirely
- Drag and drop your cut points where they *sound* best

---

## 3. 🧬 Taste-Based Presets (Lineage Slicing)

### 💡 Idea
Use **someone else's slices** — because they represent a **cultural decision**.

### 🧠 Why It Mattered
- Encoded *how a break was used in a classic track*
- Let new producers "stand on the shoulders" of veterans
- Preserved the aesthetic DNA of scenes and eras

### 🎧 Used By
- **Dillinja** — whose signature chop patterns have been obsessively catalogued
- **Optical & Ed Rush** — known for surgical edits reused across multiple tunes
- **UNKLE**, **DJ Shadow**, **Portishead** — building mood through careful reuse

### 🛠️ In RCY
- Load a preset from the `presets/` directory
- Each preset includes:
  - `measures`: defines musical scale
  - `notes.md`: cultural context
  - `color.json`: aesthetic identity

---

## 🔁 Why This Still Matters

These workflows are **not outdated** — they are **irreducible**.  
Modern tools offer elasticity, warping, spectral editing — but they lack **intentionality**.

RCY revives these three patterns not as nostalgia, but as:
- Compositional constraint
- Aesthetic encoding
- Cultural continuity

---

## 🛠 Suggested RCY Workflow

- Use **Split by Measures** when hunting for energy and surprise
- Use **Manual Slicing** when chasing vibe
- Use **Presets** when honoring lineage or borrowing taste

Together, these cover 99% of classic breakbeat logic — and create new music that still moves like it *should*.
